This is a function written in matlab to complete a LU factorization of 2 matrices of any size. In numerical analysis and linear algebra, lowerâ€“upper (LU) decomposition or factorization factors a matrix as the product of a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix (see matrix decomposition). The product sometimes includes a permutation matrix as well. LU decomposition can be viewed as the matrix form of Gaussian elimination. Computers usually solve square systems of linear equations using LU decomposition, and it is also a key step when inverting a matrix or computing the determinant of a matrix. 

* inputs:
* A - coefficient matrix
* Outputs:
* L - lower triangular matrix, with 1's along the diagonals
* U - upper triangular matrix
* P - the pivot matrix
